# Surfs_Up
## Overview of the Project
- Data analysis on a data weather set to determine if a location is suitable for opening up a surf shop. In order to determine that we looked at location, precipitation and monthly temperature rates.
## Purpose
- We learned how to use SQLAlchemy to connect and query a SQLite database. We then ran statistical analysis in order to get the mean, median, standard deviation of the temperature for specific months.Lastly, we designed a flask application using the data we acquired.

## Results
- For the month of June: the total count was 1700 with a min of 64 and max of 85.

- For the month of December: the total count was 1517 with a min of 56 and max of 85.

- While looking at the standard deviation, the difference between the two months is 0.5.
## Summary
- As shown in the graphs, the temperatures between June and December do not differ significantly. The mins and maxs are fairly similar. The data that was provided is not enough to make a conclusion as to whether temperature should be a factor in considering the surf shop. We would need to have more data from the all the season of the year to conclude how the weather is year round.
